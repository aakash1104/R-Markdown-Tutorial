# Purpose and Goals

This tutorial is intended for students in `ECS 132: Probability and Statistical Modeling for CS`, offered by the department of [Computer Science at UC Davis](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/).
After this tutorial, you will learn:

1. What `RMarkdown` is and why do we care?
2. Learn how to write your homework in `RMarkdown`
3. Learn to Embed `LaTeX` code within your `R Markdown` file
4. How to submit your homework assignments

# What is R Markdown?

Simply put, `R Markdown` is a file format to help you create dynamic documents, but with R. It uses simple `Markdown` and embeddable code chunks written in R.
It also allows you to use `LaTeX` to typeset mathematical equations. Overall, `R Markdown` produces beautiful documents and academic reports. 

We will be using `R Markdown` to write up homework solutions. Since `R Markdown` requires some prior knowledge or familiarity with `Markdown` and `LaTeX`, please make sure you check out how to write in `Markdown` [syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), and basic typesetting using `LaTeX`
[syntax](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions).

# Downloading `R-Studio` and `R Markdown`

1. `R Markdown` is an `R Studio` plugin/extension. Be sure to download `R Studio` [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2. Follow steps to finish setting up your `R Studio` IDE.

3. Once you have set up the IDE, type the following on your `R Studio` console that you should see on your screen (or on the bottom of your IDE if you have a
file open).

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

4. Congratulations! You have successfully installed `R Markdown`.

## `TeX` Engines

Since students are expected to submit `PDF` files, `R Markdown` requires a `TeX` engine installed. If you are using Windows, please make sure you have `MiKTeX` installed.
Alternatively, if you are using a Mac, make sure to install `MacTeX`.

# Creating your first `R Markdown` (`.Rmd`) File 

1. To create a new `.Rmd` file in `R Studio`, select `File >> New File >> R Markdown`.

    a. Fill in the Title and Author for your `.Rmd` file.
  
    b. Select the file type. Since you're using `R Markdown` to submit homework, select `PDF`

2. By doing this, a minimal `R Markdown` file will be created for you. Here is how it should look.

3. If you want to see the PDF the document yields, click on the `Knit` button.

4. Congratulations! You've knitted your first `.Rmd` file to create a minimal `PDF` file.

## The `YAML` Header

The first few lines in your `.Rmd` file that you see encapsulated within the `---` lines, is known as the `YAML` Header. This defines the required headers for your `.Rmd` file. For our homework assignments, shall use the
following header:

Replace the default `YAML` header with the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "ECS {Course} - Homework 0"
author:  John Doe,  \break \{jdoe\} [at] ucdavis [dot] edu # Name and Email
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  pdf_document:
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: 3
---
```

This should be self explanatory. We just define a title for our homework, the author, the date (whenever you knit), and define a default Table of Contents. There might be some pieces inside the *author* section that look strange to you.
This is because, we can only define new lines and paranthesis using `LaTeX` syntax.

## `.Rmd` File for Homework

1. To make things easier, we have provided you with a template for writing homework. Please follow the template to write your homework. You can find the file in `Canvas` or [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UC-Davis-CS-Tutoring/Academic-Templates/master/R-Markdown/HomeworkTemplate.Rmd).

2. Simply replace the existing contents with the above mentioned `.Rmd` contents from the template file.

3. `Knit` the file to a `PDF` and confirm that everything is fine. You should now  have a template homework PDF.

You should see something like this:

# Typsetting Mathematical Equations using `LaTeX`

Often times you want to write out mathematical equations or proofs. If you want to add typset mathematical equations inline do so by typing `LaTeX` code in between two `$` symbols

```
$ <Latex code> $
```

**For example:** The following `LaTeX` code

```
Let $P$ be the probability that I milk a cow. Then $Q = 1 - P$ is the probability that I don't milk a cow.
```

yields the following:

Let $P$ be the probability that I milk a cow. Then $Q = 1 - P$ is the probability that I don't milk a cow.

## Writing Multiple Line Equations Using `LaTeX`

If you want to write mathematical equations that span more than just a single line, you can do so like this:

```
$$
<Multi Line Latex Code Here>
$$
```

**For Example:** The following `LaTeX` code

```
Let $P(A) = 0.5$, $P(B) = 0.2$, $P(A \cap B) = 0.3$.

Then
$$
\begin{split}
P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\
&= 0.5 + 0.2 - 0.3 \\
&= 0.4
\end{split}
]
$$
```

yields the following:

Let $P(A) = 0.5$, $P(B) = 0.2$, $P(A \cap B) = 0.3$.

Then
$$
\begin{split}
P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\
&= 0.5 + 0.2 - 0.3 \\
&= 0.4
\end{split}
$$

Now, try to create your own multi-line `LaTeX` equation and embed it in your `.Rmd` file.

# Using and Embedding R Code Chunks

Often times, you will be asked to write some sort of R code in your homework. You want to embed your R code in your `.Rmd` file. Any R code that is to be writted and embedded in your `.Rmd` file, should be enclosed within three grave accents that
look like this: \` \` \`

Here is an example of a code chunk:

```{r someOptionalChunkName, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
n <- rnorm(10)
```

When you write a code chunk like this, `R Markdown`, by default, compiles the code, executes it, and writes the output to the file. If you want to suppress the output, then you can write a code chunk like this:

```{r someOtherChunkName, resuls='hide'}`r ''`
n <- rnorm(10)
```

If you do not wish to execute the code and just print out the code chunk, then you can write a code chunk like this:

```{r iCantThinkAnymore, eval=FALSE}`r ''`
n <- rnorm(10)
```

**Note**: Refer to `Homework_Template.Rmd` located in `Canvas` for a better understanding.

# Submitting Homework

Homework will be turned in on `Canvas`. Please make sure you turn in **BOTH**, the `.Rmd` file and the `PDF` file it yields.

Please make sure you keep the header `# Classmate Collaborators` at the end of of your `.Rmd` file. Indicate the name and the email of the student(s) you
collaborated with. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers but everyone's work must be individual.

Turning in identical `PDF` files is considered plagiarism and will result in a violation in academic conduct. 

# Final Words

Hopefully this simple tutorial should have gotten you started with getting your homework template `.Rmd` file to knit to a PDF. If you did, congrats! You can start working on the homework now :)

If you have any questions, please post your questions to our [Piazza forum](https://piazza.com/class/jm72jdwi1e95zy).
